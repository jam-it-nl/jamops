Howto start using JamOps.

---

---

## Procedure

To be able to use the JamOps tool, we have made onboarding as easy as possible, you only have to set up your personal environment once. You do not need the administrators of the JamOps tool for this either. The combination to get full access to the tool is the combination of your JamOps/Organization account and your Mendix api-key. The tool will then see which projects your account has access to and will display your projects based on this information.

Go to the url of your JamOps application. Log in with your organization account or the credentials supplied by JAM-it.

If you are successfully authenticated you will be redirected back to the tool and you will be presented with a screen for the first time to enter the following details:

- Mendix Username
- Mendix User Api key

> **ðŸ‘‹** If you click on save you will not immediately see your Mendix Apps, give the tool a few minutes to read it.
